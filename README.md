# Customer_Churn_Analysis
# Description

Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies , especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. The main contribution of our work is to develop a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn. The goal of this project is to provide a new approach to identifying potential churners so marketing retention strategies be developed accordingly. The past dataset is collected and that dataset is used to build a machine learning model. The necessary pre-processing techniques are applied like univariate analysis and bivariate
analysis are implemented. The data is visualized for better understanding of the features and based on that a classification model is built by using machine learning algorithm and comparison of different algorithms are done based on their performance metrics like accuracy, F1 score recall etc.

# Objectives

Finding the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services.

Analyzing the data in terms of various features responsible for customer Churn

Finding a most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non churn customers.
